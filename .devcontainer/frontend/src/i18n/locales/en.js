        content: "My name is Lukáš Runt. I am studying Software Engineering at the Faculty of Applied Sciences in Pilsen. Besides my studies, I work part-time at Eurosoftware, where I gain valuable experience. In my free time, I engage in various projects and sports. When it comes to sports, I enjoy cycling, running, and swimming, but I'm open to almost any sporting activity. In junior categories, I competed in cycling at the national level, but today I focus mainly on running, more for enjoyment than for results. My great passion is also traveling. One day I would like to cycle around all of Europe, climb Kilimanjaro, and explore the beauty of Asia and America. Besides the mentioned activities, I am also learning Italian and I like to spend my remaining free time with my family and friends."
